# Data Science  

This repo includes some demonstration of using data science tools. 
Currently, they are more of demonstrations of particular topics rather than wholesome projects.   

So far, I have included  

- Pandas data manipulation efficiency  
- Scikit-learn pipelines  

In the future, I would like to include  

- Using h2o  
- PySpark  
- R

as I have used them extensively in the past.
